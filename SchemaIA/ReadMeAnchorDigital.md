<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

With recent developments in Google's search algorithm, Google is looking to provide users more Local SEO queries. 

The way to do this was providing greater context to the Google search algorithm around the specific attributes of the web page. Google uses Schema JSON data that contains meta data attributes to link these relationships. 

Therefore, it was decided by Anchor Digital that the best way forward was to write JSON-LD code for clients on their landing page and the blog articles.

In this GitHub Repository you will find the readme (this file), the boilerplate JSON-LD code, and a list of all the clients that have code written for thier pages already.

### Built With JSON 

The code across all files is written in JSON with a Schema format. Both JSON and Schema docs are found below. 

* Intermediate HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how content is rendered on the webpage. 
* Working knowledge of how HTTPS request work
* Base level knowledge of APIs
* Intermediate knowledge of JSON

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [JSON](https://json-ld.org/)
* [Schema](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

All the environment needed to start on this is provided already below. 

### Prerequisites

There have been no packages or software that needs to be downloaded except that an IDE environment is downloaded to make it easier to code. 

There probably could be node.js to run within the IDE as a means of checking if the JSON is written correctly, however Schema and Google both provide a webpage for this:

[https://validator.schema.org/] -> insert the link which the code was insert into and check if the JSON is correctly written. 

If you want to go to node.js route, to install the package it's:

npm install node.js

### Installation

There is nothing to install.
